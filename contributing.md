Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
- Wait at least 30 days after creating a plugin before submitting it, to give it a chance to mature.
- If you submit a plugin that is similar to an existing plugin in the list, argue how it's better.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested plugins should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[PluginName](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Link to the GitHub repo, not nuget.org or its website.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
- Descriptions should follow sentence-case, where only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized.
- Don't mention `PowerToys Run` in the description as it's implied.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the plugin and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thanks for being awesome! ðŸ˜Ž

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is merged. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the contribution guidelines.
